# Arduino-Noise-Toy
Arduino project for a toy that uses piezo buzzers to make noises.

The basis of the toy is that there are two piezo buzzers that play a noise at the same time, each controlled by a different potentiometer that change the frequency for each.

The higher the pitch the more LEDs that light up.

Here is a basic diagram for the project:
