# Arduino-Noise-Toy
Simple Arduino sketch for a toy that uses buzzers to make noises.

The basis of the toy is that there are two buzzers that play a noise at the same time, each controlled by a different potentiometer that control the frequency for each.

LEDs will light up depending on how high the potentiometers are tuned.
